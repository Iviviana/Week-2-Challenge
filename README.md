# Users Portfolio Challenge

This weeks challenge involved writing our own HTML and CSS to make a web profile that showcases the work the user has done. The profile I made is for myself that I plan on slowly updating as I learn new techniques from class and when I get to make the websites I have planned to deploy such as Jireh Spa and the profile site for Jorge.

## Organization

The head contains the title and link to the stylesheet.

The body is divided into  parts:

## Header

The header contains links to the main page, along with navigation links to the about me, projects and contact me.

## About Me

This section contains information about the user, along with an image of the user.

## Projects

This section contains the current project the user is working on, alongside placeholders the user plans on starting in the near future. Each project is assigned an image that links or will link to a deployed website the user has made.

## Contact Me

This section contains methods to contact the user either via phone or by email.

## Footer

Contains copyright for the website and a link to the top of the page.
